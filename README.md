# InkFiltration: Using Inkjet Printers for Acoustic Data Exfiltration from Air-Gapped Networks

A covert channel can be established by leveraging the acoustic emissions of inkjet printers to exfiltrate information from an air-gapped network. In essence, malware installed on a computer with access to a printer can inject certain imperceptible patterns into all documents being sent to the printer, so as to control the printing process in such a way that an acoustic signal is generated which can be captured with a nearby smartphone.
