# Receiver

* **PrinterLeaks** is the code for the Android receiver implementation.
* In **MATLAB** the code for the MATLAB receiver implementation is found.

The results shown in our paper are the output of the MATLAB scripts, although the Android app should throw the same results. There is just one caveat with the Android app: as the signal processing is resource intensive, it will take some time before results are obtained.

PrinterLeaks requires -s16 m4a
